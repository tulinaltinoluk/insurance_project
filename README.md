Medical Insurance Cost Project - How to do EDA with good old Excel

The dataset consists of sex, age, BMI(body mass index), number of children, smoking status and region feature, which are independent and charge as a dependent feature.

In this project, we will look for answers to questions below, by simply creating pivot tables, pivot charts and statistical methods that Microsoft Excel offers.

Research Questions:

Which factors effect charges?
How do regions differ from each other?
Which reigon is the most and the least healthiest one? (in terms of smoking status, BMI score, age)
More specifically, is the «least healthy» region paid the most?
Analysis wil follow those steps:

Filtering out the relevent data,
Checking for the data quality,cleaining the data if needed,
Creating BMI and age scores in reference to scientific guidelines,
Detecting outliers, testing for normal distribution, calculating correlation between variables,
Creating pivot charts in order to set a ground for new hypotheses.
